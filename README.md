Hi, I'm Madden. With over three years of coding experience, I'm well-versed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, bringing a variety of technical skills to every project.
Alongside my joy for coding, I have strong knowledge and interest in Adobe apps like Premiere Pro, Photoshop, Lightroom and After Effects.
